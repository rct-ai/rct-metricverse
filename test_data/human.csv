0	human	0		Hi!	What is your favorite holiday?
0	human	1		one where I get to meet lots of different people.	What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?
0	human	2		Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.	Which holiday was that?
0	human	3		I think it was Australia	Do you still talk to the people you met?
0	human	4		Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them	Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?
0	human	5		what do you mean?	I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as cold readings to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.
0	human	6		Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky	There's this practice called Treasure Hunting that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called The Ultimate Treasure Hunt that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.
0	human	7		So, do you do treasure hunting often?	I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.
1	human	0		Hi	Any plans for the weekend?
1	human	1		my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!	That's great! How's the weather over the weekend? I hope its warm.
1	human	2		Should be very sunny! you?	Cool! very depressing plans ... stay home and work üòû I have a project deadline very close.
1	human	3		üòê hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!	Right, very anxious! where do you plan to go for a hike?
1	human	4		I am going to Diablo!	Nice, where is that place? I haven't been there
1	human	5		hours drive from here. still in bay area	That's cool! How long is the hike?
1	human	6		Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.	nice! sounds fun!
2	human	0		Hi!	Hey there! What's up???
2	human	1		Nothing much, how you doin?	I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D
2	human	2		Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?	The last time in New York, back in June.
2	human	3		Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...	Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently
2	human	4		Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?	Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?
2	human	5		Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!	What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?
2	human	6		Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?	I'd love to try! Can we schedule something for next week?
2	human	7		Sure! What does your Saturday look like?	Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?
4	human	0		Hi.	Helloooooo!
4	human	1		How are you? How is your day?	Good. Don't have much to do today, feels good. How are you?
4	human	2		I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.	So what's your outlook? Something blue?
4	human	3		Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?	You should drink more water, do some push up, and sleep early.
5	human	0		Hi!	Hey, how are you?
5	human	1		I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.	Oh no‚Ä¶ Have you sent out the missing cat posters? Hope your cat is alright!
5	human	2		Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?	Yea, I know they love the plastic bag sound all the time. I am good, nothing special though.
5	human	3		If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?	I like rainforest, but I know it requires extensive training beforehand.
5	human	4		I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.	I am afraid I will be scared of doing this :)
5	human	5		I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.	I don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia. I want to take plenty of it if I really have to do it.
5	human	6		If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions	That's a great idea! Maybe alcohol is such a thing.
5	human	7		Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!	Oops. I won't do it again. Ha
6	human	0		Hi!	Hey sup
6	human	1		not much. any plans this weekend?	I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?
6	human	2		ziplining?	that's the one! have you ever tried it?
6	human	3		i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience	where did you do it?
6	human	4		i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though	no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?
6	human	5		that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you	sure. are you just going home now?
6	human	6		no, i'm going to get a massage first	nice. what type?
6	human	7		traditional kind	yeah I want to get one too soon
6	human	8		you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!	ttyl!
7	human	0		Hi!	Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?
7	human	1		I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?	I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies
7	human	2		it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature	That sounds really cool! I think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good!
7	human	3		yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?	I enjoy baking cookies. I am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie üôÇ What about you?
7	human	4		I enjoy eating üôÇ	so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie
7	human	5		I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?	thanks! I generally love noodle soups like Pho or Ramen :)
7	human	6		Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?	I prefer to go out. I'm not a good cook haha
7	human	7		Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook	seems like we share a thing in common, yay!
8	human	0		Hi!	Good afternoon!
8	human	1		How has your week been?	So far so good. It is holiday season. So just chilling
8	human	2		I think I'm getting sick with a cold üòû So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.	lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?
8	human	3		Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.	üòÇ
8	human	4		Do you have big plans?	Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.
8	human	5		I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.	lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.
8	human	6		Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.	üòÇ
10	human	0		Hi!	Hey
10	human	1		How's your day going?	pretty good. yours?
10	human	2		Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..	oh what happened?
10	human	3		Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')	hahah wait for real?
10	human	4		I know right! Are you taking History next semester?	No I'm not in school anymore
10	human	5		Oh I see. What do you do?	I train and compete in horse vaulting
10	human	6		Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?	lol you're too funny
10	human	7		Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?	Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything
10	human	8		Wow, sounds very busy! Do you win money at those horse vaulting competitions?	Yeah some. enough to get by
12	human	0		Hi!	Hey how's it going
12	human	1		It's good it's good. How are you?	good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool
12	human	2		Oh nice! Where do you live?	I live in Tokyo, Japan
12	human	3		Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....	oh have you been?
12	human	4		Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!	what did you do here?
12	human	5		Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha	lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?
12	human	6		The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!	oh neat. I haven't heard about that robot fighting show. where is that??
12	human	7		I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google giant robot fighting show tokyo haha	lol ok
13	human	0		Hi!	Have you seen any good movies lately?
13	human	1		Last weekend I saw The Parasite. Ever heard of it?	No. Why did you pick that movie?
13	human	2		My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?	I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.
13	human	3		Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!	Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol
13	human	4		lol Are you a big Marvel fan?	I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?
13	human	5		I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha	Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.
13	human	6		Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha	Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome üòÄ
13	human	7		Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before	He's the adopted brother of Thor, God of thunder, and is burdened with glorious purpose. Do you feel that burden?
14	human	0		Hi!	Hey, what's up?
14	human	1		Just chillin'. how are you?	I'm pretty good, thanks.
14	human	2		Do anything interesting today?	I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?
14	human	3		Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!	Oh my gosh. What was it like??
14	human	4		It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?	No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.
14	human	5		Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?	No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.
14	human	6		Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha	Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?
14	human	7		Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?	I think I sort of understand :)
16	human	0		Hi!	Hello
16	human	1		How's it going?	Extremely busy. I have been trying to prepare for the upcoming holidays. How about you?
16	human	2		I'm going to the bahamas. Can't wait!!!	I'm jealous, take me with you!! I would love to have some warm weather right now
16	human	3		oh where are you now?	Canada. There is another major snowstorm that might hit this weekend so I have been rushing to get everything done before it comes.
16	human	4		oh no. I never seen this in person. Is it scary?	Snow is not scary as long as you're prepared. You just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while. I enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing.
16	human	5		that does sound nice. so what are you doing these holidays?	I am having all of the extended family over for a big meal. We will also go <REDACTED_TERM> as well. What will you do in the bahamas?
16	human	6		nice nice. I'm gonna go snorkeling yey	Sounds fun! I wish I knew how to swim!
16	human	7		You can stay on the shallow side I think. Well hope you enjoy time with your extended family!	That's true. You too, have a great time snorkeling!
17	human	0		Hi!	Hi! How was your weekend?
17	human	1		pretty good. just went to church and hangout with friends	Nice
17	human	2		did you do anything?	I made donuts and samosas with an air fryer have you used one of those before
17	human	3		yum yum yum no only good old oily frier	haha
17	human	4		do you have one at your home or were you at a friends place?	I was at my parents' place what are you up to for Thanksgiving?
17	human	5		I'm going to impersonate a pumpkin	wow, those are unique plans
17	human	6		I'm pretty unique person	I think so too
17	human	7		any other hobbies besides air frying everything? üôÇ	I want to start fermenting things kimchi for example sounds like a fun thing to ferment takes a few days apparently miso takes a couple years to fermen
19	human	0		Hi!	hello, who am I having the pleasure to chat with üôÇ
19	human	1		I am the superman! What about you?	haha. great chating with superman, what is your power?
19	human	2		Being invisible. You won't see me.	haha. what else can you do? can you read minds?
19	human	3		I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!	wow that seems pretty technical. what does fMRI mean?
19	human	4		The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.	okay! so you seem to like science a lot?
19	human	5		I believe in Science! Science is my god!	Are you also doing science?
19	human	6		no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?	People are always arguing. Probably both science and democracy are both important I guess.
19	human	7		Does it make sense?	I think so. thanks for your point!
27	human	0		Hi!	Hey there how's it going
27	human	1		All good, you?	Good. I've been trying to learn how to swim
27	human	2		How has that been going?	Not great, but I got really good at sort of swimming on my back haha
27	human	3		that's too bad hopefully with practice it'll get better what about the doggy paddle haha	haha what's that
27	human	4		Corgi belly flop COMPILATION - cute funny dogs Corgi Flop <REDACTED_LINK>	ouch. do you think that hurts?
27	human	5		from a high enough distance, yes?	yeah. any vacation plans?
27	human	6		no so far sadly you? a relative is coming to visit for thanksgiving though	just going to hang out around here and eat Turkey
27	human	7		that's still pretty fun are you going to cook the turkey yourself?	yeah. I'm gonna watch a video to figure it out
29	human	0		Hi!	Hello! How are you doing üôÇ
29	human	1		I'm great! How's your day going?	Pretty good! I'm going to a class later in the afternoon
29	human	2		Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?	No, I'm working full time! It's a sewing class at a makerspace near my office What about you? Do you work full or part time?
29	human	3		Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!	Yup! I work in a technical role so I like to take arts and crafts-type classes now and then üôÇ Pottery sounds like a lot of fun
29	human	4		I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.	Any plans to build a custom tea set? My family is also very into tea Mostly from tea from china
29	human	5		I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?	I really enjoy barley tea What about you?
29	human	6		Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.	Hmm I'm not sure, I just get them from a Chinese supermarket haha You seem really knowledgeable about the different kinds of teas üôÇ What made you develop this interest?
29	human	7		I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.	Oh cool! What are your favorite channels to watch?
31	human	0		Hi!	Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!
31	human	1		Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?	It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.
31	human	2		Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?	Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.
31	human	3		Hehe! How long was the stay?	10 days in total, and 5 of them were spent in the cave. What have I missed at work in those days?
31	human	4		Great! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.reat! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.	Oh, so you are already planning for the next quarter. This whole team is always living the future.
31	human	5		Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts üôÇ I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing.	Yeah. Some people underestimate the importance of planning, but I think it's very important to have the correct plan. Executing the wrong plan is terrible. Also, planning is fun. You can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks.
31	human	6		True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?	Yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me. Let me set a time on your calendar. Is 3pm good?
31	human	7		Okay. See tomorrow then.	see you!
37	human	0		Hi!	Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?
37	human	1		I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?	I just got a matcha latte üôÇ Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity
37	human	2		Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?	I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise
37	human	3		I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?	Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?
37	human	4		I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.	What do you do in your free time?
37	human	5		I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.	Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too üôÇ My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.
37	human	6		What's the most recent good thing you read?	My recent favorites have been mostly sci-fi (Exhalations, Vita Nostra and Dark Matter) but I like a lot of Sanderson/Garth Nix fantasy books
38	human	0		Hi!	hey, what's up?
38	human	1		What do you think about human like chat bots?	I can't wait for them to be great conversationalists!
38	human	2		Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives	are there even any negatives? what are they?
38	human	3		Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)	People can already impersonate other people though! I think it'd be great to have bots to converse with
38	human	4		True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)	What do you think are the big advantages? Like personal assistants?
38	human	5		I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems üôÇ Sort of like stepping on the moon üôÇ I might be overselling it here üòõ	No, I agree -- it's such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it. I wonder if I'll be able someday to get a chatbot to just auto-suggest conversations for me
38	human	6		The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good üôÇ	Yeah those are actually really good for a few words! I'm imagining like it comes up with a whole conversational response, like a default template
38	human	7		haha, pretty far fetched üôÇ Nice having this conversation with you!	Same with you!
41	human	0		Hi!	Do you believe in miracles?
41	human	1		Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.	Should we be helping them, so it sucks less?\
41	human	2		It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.	Haha... Well, it sounds like career is really important to you. What matters to you the most in life?
41	human	3		Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?	I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime. It's probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child.
41	human	4		We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.	Does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand?
41	human	5		It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?	I grew up in the United States, but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money, so we moved to Taiwan to live with family for a little bit.
41	human	6		ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?	I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental. Would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background?
44	human	0		Hi!	Hey! How are you feeling today?
44	human	1		Good you?	I'm a little scared because I have to cook dinner for some friends tonight.
44	human	2		where did you meet them?	At college, when we were all studying geology.
44	human	3		cool. have you graduated already?	Yes, we graduated back in the seventies. We meet for dinner every year and take turns to host.
44	human	4		neat. what are y'all eating?	I don't know!! That's what I'm scared about. Everyone else is a great cook and I'm a klutz. Do you like cooking?
44	human	5		lol what's a klutz? yeah I like, but I'm not good	What's your favorite dish to cook? Do you have a go-to?
44	human	6		ground beef pretty easy	Ah, solid. What's your favorite sport?
44	human	7		I like badminton. I'm quite decent at it	I played that in high school once or twice. I liked that it's pretty easy for beginners, unlike, say, squash.
44	human	8		I never played squash. would love to try	Don't! It's very hard! You feel like an idiot until you've practiced for months and months.
45	human	0		hi	i was talking to robot all the time:)
45	human	1		haha. what are you talking about?	kpop...
45	human	2		ok. who's your favorite group	i dont like kpop now
45	human	3		why not?	im old now
45	human	4		hahaha	what do you like now?
45	human	5		john mayer:)\	I think I know him. does he have a sort of mellow style?
45	human	6		what is mellow style	I think it's like a bit sad and slow
45	human	7		umm yes he has some but not all	you mean some songs of his are like that but not all?
45	human	8		yes I do. you act like a robot how about me? am I like a robot?	a little bit haha
46	human	0		Hi!	Hi
46	human	1		Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.	Sure, whats the scenario?
46	human	2		My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.	That's a tough scenario to be in üôÇ I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.
46	human	3		I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.	True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.
46	human	4		AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?	Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.
46	human	5		People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.	Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you üòâ
46	human	6		Lol. I'm finna be single.	Hehe, everyone is much finer being single üôÇ
47	human	0		Hi!	Hello there!
47	human	1		How's your day going?	I've seen better days, how about you?
47	human	2		I'm good I'm good. What's getting you down?	The clouds overhead are playing on your mind, any plans for the coming vacations?
47	human	3		I'm thinking of going to visit my family. How about you?	Was thinking the same, where does your family live?
47	human	4		They're in New York. How about yours?	Mine is in India, it is a long way away.
47	human	5		Ahh what city? I've visited India before.	Hyderabad, it is a beautiful city in the southern part of India. Which cities have you gone to in India?
47	human	6		Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?	It varies, but can go till 30C in the winters as well. New York must be snowing right?
47	human	7		Yes. I was actually just there a few weeks ago for Thanksgiving and got to see the first snow of the season! Ever been to New York?	No, I've never been to the East Coast, thinking of going after the winter, I don't like the cold.
48	human	0		Hi!	Hey, how are you?
48	human	1		I'm good. How are you doing today?	Great, just had some delicious lunch. How about you?
48	human	2		I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?	nice! Garbanzo fritters and mussels üôÇ
48	human	3		Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!	yeah, it's very healthy too. I want to someday go crabbing..it is really popular in SF
48	human	4		Oh nice! Is it hard?	not really, it just requires a lot of patience. You fill up the bait in the crab-pot and drop it in the ocean. Then you wait for a couple of hours to pull the crab-pots out, and voila, you'd have crabs -- if you are lucky!
48	human	5		Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?	nah! Just watched a lot of youtube videos
48	human	6		haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?	nope, but I've seen a lot of videos on that too
48	human	7		Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?	depends on the day. Some days I'm very outdoorsy, on others I just like to be inside
49	human	0		Hi!	Hi there
49	human	1		How's your day going?	So far so good. It is Wednesday. To more days, yeah
49	human	2		Haha are you looking forward to the weekend?	Yeah, gonna watch <REDACTED_TERM> with my friends. First time. So excited.
49	human	3		Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?	Live in san jose This Saturday.
49	human	4		Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha	Yeah! That what I heard as well. There are players just for fight! Wow, must be fun to watch lol Are you planning anything for the weekend?
49	human	5		You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!	lol I will try if I can watch ufc live üòâ Wow, when did you start jiu jitsu?
49	human	6		It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.	wow, that's amazing. Good luck with it!
49	human	7		Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!	lol I will cross my fingers for you then
51	human	0		Hi!	Hey! How's your day been?
51	human	1		It's good! I spent most of it watching horse racing. How about yourself?	nice! what's your favorite part about watching horse racing? My day has been pretty busy, but I had a nice lunch with a friend. It was good to catchup with him
51	human	2		I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?	The last I saw him was a month ago! So yup it was great Haha, nice üôÇ Got any fun plans for the weekend?
51	human	3		I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?	Nope I haven't, have you been fishing before?
51	human	4		Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?	Haha üòÜ Yeah I get sea sick on boats too Nothing much, just visiting some friends in San Francisco
51	human	5		Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?	Yeah I would say maybe every couple weeks or so what are your favorite cities to visit?
51	human	6		New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?	nice! I love NYC üôÇ so fun to visit yeah I would probably also say New York is my favorite city inside the US I also like Paris, it's so pretty there
51	human	7		Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.	You should, it's a beautiful city!
52	human	0		Hi!	Hello, how are you doing today?
52	human	1		I heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen.	I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?
52	human	2		I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold üôÇ	That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?
52	human	3		Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!	Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.
52	human	4		Oh nice! Where did you live before?	Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now
52	human	5		New york! Nice! Best place to live üôÇ .. right, except for the cold!	Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!
52	human	6		Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.	Very true. Which MK were they in again?
52	human	7		The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.	Sounds good, thanks!
53	human	0		Hi!	How's your day going?
53	human	1		Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?	Likewise. What have you been up to that gives you so much work?
53	human	2		A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving üôÇ Do you have any fun plans for the break?	What is a break? I'm a grad student. I don't understand the concept of a break. Just kidding. I don't have any plan. Probably just going to work through the break.
53	human	3		Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?	I go to the gym and run until I find enough fun.
53	human	4		cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles	A couple of miles is very impressive. When I started, I couldn't even last 1 mile.
53	human	5		haha	I'm exhausted by the end of it though üòõ Do you like to run long distances or mostly sprints?
53	human	6		I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.	wow! that's amazing did you do any marathons this year?
53	human	7		No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.	oh wow, what was the last half marathon you did?
53	human	8		Two days ago. It was a tough one.	Cool!
59	human	0		Hi!	Hello, how is your day?
59	human	1		It's good. It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?	It's good, I just got back from walking my dog What book did you read?
59	human	2		I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?	No, what is it about?
59	human	3		It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?	Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book
59	human	4		Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?	Yes!
59	human	5		The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn	Woah! That is fascinating! I will have to pick up a copy of the book to read.
59	human	6		There are other twists as well, so I haven't spoiled the whole thing! To be honest I am not a fan of spoilers	Thanks for not spoiling it completely but you gave a really intriguing description that makes me want to read it now. I will have to pick it up after work
59	human	7		The audi book is also very good! Ever give those a try?	I only gave those a try when I had a concussion and could not read. I enjoy having a physical book in hand and reading at the pace I prefer. Do you listen to a lot of audi books?
60	human	0		Hi!	Hey, how's it going?
60	human	1		It's good! How is your day?	My day is good. A bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well. Did you do anything fun over the weekend?
60	human	2		Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?	Rock climbing sounds fun! I had a pretty low-key weekend. Ended up going to watch a movie.
60	human	3		Oh nice! What movie?	Knives Out. It had Daniel Craig and one of the famous Captain America Chris person (I can't keep track of all of the famous Chris names).
60	human	4		Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!	Cool. So if it weren't so dark and cold outside, what kind of activities would you do?
60	human	5		Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!	Yeah, sunlight is good. I wish I could live part-time in different parts of the world to have summer all year round. Have you ever visited the southern hemisphere?
60	human	6		Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?	I've always wanted to go to Australia. I'm originally from the US.
60	human	7		Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!	Will do! Bye.
61	human	0		Hi!	What's your name?
61	human	1		My name is pikachu. it‚Äôs nice to meet you! What are you up to this month?	Nice to meet you pikachu! pikachu, pikachu, pikachu? (That meant, I'm literally catching Pokemons on my phone right now!) What're you up to lately?
61	human	2		I‚Äôm trying to organize my life and start the new year ready to go! What about you?	Wow, that's impressive. Admit I'm just trying to take each day and week as they come.
61	human	3		What do you do to unwind?	Honestly, I like to catch Pokemons on my phone a lot. That must be upsetting since your name is pikachu though...sorry...
61	human	4		Oddly enough, I also catch Pok√©mon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.	Oooh, that is more fun, but I don't travel that much these days so I'm grateful when I spot a Pokemon to catch where ever I happen to be. Do you have a favorite Pokemon? Mine is the cute pink JIgglypuff!
61	human	5		In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that‚Äôs why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?	I have heard of him and seen him here and there, but admit I don't have Disney+, so I only heard baby yoda is super cute and popular. Maybe I'll binge watch The Mandalorian in a couple of years like I did Game of Thrones...
61	human	6		What is your favorite show to watch right now?	Admit I really like watching Modern Family and Mix-ish. Reruns and new episodes. I find them cleverly written. What're you watching these days on TV?
61	human	7		I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.	Oh dear, I never imagined that happening. Poor things, but good to hear they're being rescued.
61	human	8		Do you like cats or dogs better? Do you have any pets?	I used to have a cat, hamster and fighting fish, but they've all lived long lives and gone to pet heaven, but I sure miss them.
63	human	0		Hi!	hello there, nice seeing you
63	human	1		Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?	oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?
63	human	2		Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.	awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?
63	human	3		Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.	Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?
63	human	4		Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?	Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.
63	human	5		but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve	Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.
63	human	6		Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?	I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?
63	human	7		Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.	hopefully they don't lose any in the trip. Its going to be hard to explain to them how santa managed to find us in the hotel!
64	human	0		Hi!	Hi! How's your day going?
64	human	1		I'm doing well. having many meetings today üôÇ	Haha, nice
64	human	2		what are you up to?	Lots of meetings as well üôÇ Do you have any fun plans for Thanksgiving?
64	human	3		we're gonna play board games and will be eating lots of food! what about you?	Cool! Planning to spend a couple days at Tahoe What kind of board games do you like?
64	human	4		we've been doing Games of Thrones lately. the game takes a very long time to finish though!	Cool! Do you watch Game of Thrones?
64	human	5		I do. I'm a super fan of it (not the last season though haha). did you watch?	haha, nope I don't watch it, but my roommate is super into it what other TV shows do you like?
64	human	6		I love Survivor üôÇ	what about you?
64	human	7		nice! I mostly like comedy shows like The Good Place and Modern Family	cool, I'll check them out!
65	human	0		Hi!	Hello
65	human	1		How's your day going?	Good so far. How's yours?
65	human	2		Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...	Oh! That's bad! How long will it take to get it fixed?
65	human	3		The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.	Haha! Hope it doesn't take too long. Let me know if you are able to make it for lunch.
65	human	4		Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?	Oh, I have a packed schedule today at work. I will find time in about an hour. Let me know if that works.
65	human	5		That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?	no, i was busy catching up with a friend. I heard they played really well. Rooting for them this season üôÇ Ahh, they lost again üòû Things aren't going to be too good until Steph gets better! Oh! I think they will find a way. The team still looks too strong to me.
65	human	6		Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!	hehe, i am true fan! Well anyways let me know how the repair work goes. I need to run now for a meeting. ttyl
66	human	0		Hi	Hello!
66	human	1		any improvements in your marathon time?	No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races
66	human	2		I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?	I think a triathalon would be cool
66	human	3		I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons	I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?
66	human	4		It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun	oh wow a full obstable course. that does sound fun! I like the variety
66	human	5		Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey	hmm that sounds very soon. would there be enough time to train? I think I would like to try one later in the year
66	human	6		1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.	ok, sign me up. it's more fun to do it with friends
66	human	7		Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.	Sounds good!
68	human	0		Hi!	hey, whats up?
68	human	1		I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?	well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!
68	human	2		I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?	I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?
68	human	3		No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?	not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much üòû. I might join some of the study sessions later
68	human	4		Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.	not my ideal idea of a weekend, but I guess it'll have to be like that.
68	human	5		True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.	yeah, our professor really goes out of their way to make the class interesting, glad I managed to get in it.
68	human	6		Thats pretty cool! I hope you do well next week.	thank you, bye!
69	human	0		Hi!	Hello!
69	human	1		How was your party last week?	It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey
69	human	2		haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?	*ate üòÇ
69	human	3		Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways	So much turkey leftovers
69	human	4		did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?	We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha
69	human	5		Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken üòâ	chicken also sounds good
69	human	6		we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?	We played pictionary. I never played before but it was a bunch of fun. what did you play?
69	human	7		Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.	that sounds very challenging
70	human	0		Hi!	hello
70	human	1		how is the youtube video creation going?	going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc
70	human	2		Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?	I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern
70	human	3		oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?	I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime
70	human	4		Nice.... you are a rockstar! üòâ	haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?
70	human	5		Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week	nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord
70	human	6		yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though	right, but bar chords are so versatile, almost like cheating as in you can play anything with the same gesture
70	human	7		That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word	will spend more time work on my bar chord!
71	human	0		Hi!	Hey! How‚Äôs your day going?
71	human	1		Bruhhhhhh!!!!!	What??
71	human	2		I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.	Oh no! What‚Äôs happened?
71	human	3		A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.	Ah that sucks. At least it‚Äôs not personal. Not that it helps right now, but that does happen all the time
71	human	4		Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?	Well, no, of course not! Let me stick with ‚ÄúAh that sucks‚Äù by itself, then.
71	human	5		No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?	Haha, apart from having my leg pulled mercilessly, it‚Äôs going great ;). My main problem today is deciding what to have for lunch.
71	human	6		Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.	Oh I hear a lot about keto. I‚Äôm trying to watch my weight, would you recommend it?
73	human	0		Hi!	Hey!
73	human	1		How's your day going?	Having fun, but have a bit of a headache How about you?
73	human	2		I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!	Haha, thanks! Never get them, so it's super weird Who's playing?
73	human	3		Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?	I haven't Honestly I probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played
73	human	4		Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!	lol, sounds better to me :) I'm actually at the <REDACTED_TERM> opening remarks
73	human	5		Oh cool! What is NeurIPS?	Neural Information Processing Systems
73	human	6		Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?	It's the biggest ML conference in the world
73	human	7		Oh, ML?	Yes, machine learning
73	human	8		Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?	I've definitely heard of it, but somehow never saw it!
74	human	0		Hi!	Hello
74	human	1		how's it going?!?	Good so far. Very excited about the game later today.
74	human	2		what game?	Giants game. I got tickets for the game.
74	human	3		nice. that's football right?	Yes, I think the traffic will be bad. I need to leave by 4.
74	human	4		ok. what stadium is it at?	Its the one close to mathilda. 15 mins driver from here. You have any plans for the weekend?
74	human	5		yeah I'm gonna go kayaking	Kayaking sounds fun! I tried it in our last team offsite.
74	human	6		is it easy to flip over accidentally? it's gonna be my first time actually	I found it very tough to learn, but my friends picked it up very quickly. I am sure you will do good.
74	human	7		thanks!	Cool! I need to run for a meeting. Talk to you later.
75	human	0		Hi!	Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?
75	human	1		It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?	Oh thats right, I did not see that. Well, I'm not sure... maybe at a party? I'm very bad remembering people so maybe its just that. How are you doing?
75	human	2		Did we dance together perchance?	We might have, I don't remember that much of that night.
75	human	3		Lol. Were you schwasty?	Maybe a little bit. Where do you work?
75	human	4		I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?	Thats pretty cool! I'm a sofa tester in cupertino.
75	human	5		I'm not sure I know what that is.	well its very simple, I test how comfortable sofas are.
75	human	6		Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?	Yeah! It is a very demanding job, requires a carefully crafted set of skills. They pay is really good too.
77	human	0		Hi!	Hey, how are you?
77	human	1		Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good	ohh, what kind of hint did it have?
77	human	2		watermelon	nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor
77	human	3		I see. Yeah some are pretty strange	Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?
77	human	4		lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird	haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream
77	human	5		that sounds pretty tasty actually	It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad
77	human	6		do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place	As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places
77	human	7		lol	But I do know some gelato places which are amazing! You should try out those
78	human	0		Hi!	Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?
78	human	1		Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha	Darn it! I hoped I‚Äôd guess right. What do you actually do for work?
78	human	2		I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?	I had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting, but that might have been because I‚Äôm hungry.
78	human	3		haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...	Hahah love it. Do you have a specialty or favourite type of cake?
78	human	4		Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?	Ok this is a bit shameful to admit, but I love a classic carrot cake.

78	human	6		Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?	I trained in contemporary and jazz, so I can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows. So it ends up being all sorts of styles.
78	human	7		Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.	Yes, it's different every week, and I love that. Are you ever tempted to try crazy new cakes just to see what would happen?

83	human	5		Have you seen Rick and Morty ?	Yup! I watch that show with my friends I haven't gotten very far in it though What about you
83	human	6		Oh nice! I heard its latest season arrived last month. I have watched all previous seasons. Its a total mind bender üôÇ	I've seen a couple episodes from the latest season. It's really random and weird but also strangely relatable which is why I like it :)
87	human	0		Hi!	Hi! How are you doing today?
87	human	1		I'm doing great how are you??	I'm doing good. Just having some morning tea
87	human	2		are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?	I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?
87	human	3		I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha	I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!
87	human	4		that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?	Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more üôÇ If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?
87	human	5		I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?	Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.
87	human	6		hahaha that's a great way to put it	You should definitely try tubing the next time you head towards the mountains during the winter!
87	human	7		Yeah. I'll try to get a group together. ttyl!	See ya!
88	human	0		Hi!	Hey!
88	human	1		how's week so far?	pretty good, excited for thanksgiving you?
88	human	2		Same. Going to catch up on my reading! do you have a feast planned?	yup! gonna have dinner with family what books are you gonna read?
88	human	3		Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll <REDACTED_LINK>	ahh nice what kind of books do you usually like to read
88	human	4		largely scifi How about you?	yeah I also like scifi and some non-fiction too have you read Seveneves by Neal Stephenson?
88	human	5		I haven't what is it about?	the moon is shattered by an asteroid and the pieces of the moon end up clouding the earth's atmostphere which causes almost every living creature on the planet to go extinct that's the premise of the book and the book is about the survivors
88	human	6		how do the survivors survive such a thing?	they go into space and they live there
88	human	7		sounds like a tv show I watched	really? which one
88	human	8		can't quite remember. something about survivors going to live in space	ah nice
90	human	0		Hi!	Hello there!
90	human	1		How has your morning been thus far?	Its alright. Went grocery shopping and got to stroll around in the rain. How about you?
90	human	2		Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.	Oh, you mean going through a lot of work? I usually take Wednesdays off because I work the weekends!
90	human	3		WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?	I actually don't have a choice. I'm an acupuncturist and all my clients want to be treated on the weekend!
90	human	4		Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?	I went to school for it and so I find the literature quite convincing. I've also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice. It revolves around the Chinese notion of Qi.
90	human	5		Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?	Haha. All good questions! I don't have studies on hand at the moment, but perhaps I can send some to you later! What do you do for work?
90	human	6		I'm a comic.	Oh wow! What's your best joke?
90	human	7		It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.	Haha fantastic
91	human	0		Hi!	Oh hey. How's your day been?
91	human	1		It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?	The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.
91	human	2		Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?	I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.
91	human	3		hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??	All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.
91	human	4		Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?	Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.
91	human	5		Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?	Yes and no. Because it's obviously dangerous, we all have to wear protective clothes. Thus, accidents almost never happen.
91	human	6		Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.	Yes, it's the same philosophy. You seem to know a lot about mountain climbing. Do you climb a lot?
91	human	7		I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?	I climb very occasionally. My fingertips are not strong enough so I never make too much progress.
92	human	0		Hi!	hi, what's up!
92	human	1		Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?	I'm doing well. holiday season is the best thing to have!
92	human	2		Do you have interesting plans?	yea I'm travelling to Vancouver this weekend. what about you? üôÇ
92	human	3		Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.	ah a mix of both conference and sight-seeing üôÇ anything beautiful sight-seeing places or good food I should try?
92	human	4		Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.	yea it's <REDACTED_TERM>, the largest machine learning conference. I'll check out Kingyo, do we need to make reservation in advance?
92	human	5		I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?	hmm not the local people but there will be tons of people at the conference üôÇ
92	human	6		You attend these often?	yea, you?
93	human	0		Hi!	Hello!
93	human	1		Have you had lunch yet?	Yes I've eaten
93	human	2		Cool. Where and what did you eat?	I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha
93	human	3		A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.	thats a lot of meat what dish? Why are you consideringt o go vetegarian?
93	human	4		Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.	What do you think of those meatless burgers then?
93	human	5		I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?	I really like the impossible burger Which one is your favorite?
93	human	6		I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?	I didn't know that it had peanut butter in it
