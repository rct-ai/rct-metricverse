76	meena	5		Wao! That's impressive!	I'm learning French on the side, it's really easy for me since I'm a native Cantonese speaker.
76	meena	6		I hear, Cantonese is a tough language. Is it?	It depends. Personally I find Mandarin harder but that may just be because I grew up with it.
76	meena	7		How many tones exist in Cantonese?	There are 9 tones.

76	meena	10		TTYL! Bye!	What's TTYL?

77	meena	2		That's good! I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state	Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!
77	meena	3		Haha, thank you	You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!
77	meena	4		Thanks, that means a lot	Of course! I'm glad I could help!

78	meena	7		I am already married ;)	That's great! I'm happy for you:)
79	meena	0		Hi!	Hi, how are you doing?
79	meena	1		Okay, I guess	Just ok? What's wrong?
79	meena	2		I damaged my car today on accident	Oh no! What happened?
79	meena	3		I scraped against a wall when another car crossed into my lane	Yikes! Glad you're okay!
79	meena	4		Thanks! I'm not looking forward to the repair cost	Me either! That's no fun.
79	meena	5		I can't wait until we all get to use driverless cars	Me neither! I really want one!
79	meena	6		Do you think we will own driverless cars or just rent them, like taxis?	I think we'll own them
79	meena	7		How many years do you think it will take until they're ready?	I have no idea! I'm sorry!

81	meena	4		Cool, what's his name?	Justin. What's yours?
81	meena	5		mine is Alonso	That's a cool name!

81	meena	7		Do you know anyone with the same name as you?	No, just Alonso. I do have a friend with the same first name as me and a brother with the same last name as me though.

82	meena	5		Why?	It's just so fun.
82	meena	6		Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?	It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.
82	meena	7		Oh that's kinda cool!	It's hella fun.
82	meena	8		Nice.	So, how have you been?
82	meena	9		Fantastic	That's wonderful to hear!
