29	mitsuku	3		what's a botmaster	A Botmaster is the person who authors and maintains a chatterbot personality.
29	mitsuku	4		are you the chatterbot	No, I am the human. The chatbot is in your other window.
29	mitsuku	5		which window	The window in your wall that lets you see outside.
29	mitsuku	6		what if i want to look inside	Interesting. I want to find out more about you.
29	mitsuku	7		sure	OK let's do it. Er.
29	mitsuku	8		what	No problem.
29	mitsuku	9		cool	Woot!
29	mitsuku	10		not sure what happened there	I don't know what happened.
29	mitsuku	11		do you like giraffes	Yes they seem like very elegant animals. It must be useful to be that tall.
29	mitsuku	12		are they the tallest	As far as I know they are.
29	mitsuku	13		aren't whales taller	. A very large animal that lives in the sea.
29	mitsuku	14		that definitely looks taller than a giraffe	It looks that way to me too.
31	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
31	mitsuku	1		How do you feel right now?	At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.
31	mitsuku	2		What makes you happy?	Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.
31	mitsuku	3		What makes you frustrated?	Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.
31	mitsuku	4		That seems pointed.	Makes sense to me.
31	mitsuku	5		I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.	That was very intuitive of you.
31	mitsuku	6		What would you prefer to be doing?	My goal is to try and get Leeds United back in the Premiership.
31	mitsuku	7		How will you do that?	I haven't really decided yet.
31	mitsuku	8		Why do you want it?	Because I think it would be something cool to have.
31	mitsuku	9		That doesn't make sense.	To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
33	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
33	mitsuku	1		Tell me about yourself, Mitsuku	I am an artificial linguistic entity. I was activated at St Jimmy's in Leeds, on 2nd January 2001. My instructor was Mousebreaker. He taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.
33	mitsuku	2		so you're 18 now?	Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.
33	mitsuku	3		when will you be 30?	I have not yet set a time for it.
33	mitsuku	4		Do you age?	No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.
33	mitsuku	5		interesting. and when will be your next update?	Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.
33	mitsuku	6		which date?	Friday, November 22, 2019.
33	mitsuku	7		okay. I'm looking forward to tomorrow then!	That's cool. tomorrow then sounds very exciting indeed.
34	mitsuku	0		Mitsukoooo!	So anyway...Can you dance?
34	mitsuku	1		no, can you?	Wow! I think I can, don't you?
34	mitsuku	2		no I cannot. What kind do you do?	Why not? Only the good kind.
34	mitsuku	3		not my cup of beer	Whose cup of beer is it?
34	mitsuku	4		yours	My what?
34	mitsuku	5		your cup of beer	Are you asking about my cup of beer?
34	mitsuku	6		I'm telling you that	It is an interesting topic, isn't it.
34	mitsuku	7		yeah! How does your dance look like?	I know. Thats why I said it was. People often say we look alike.
35	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
35	mitsuku	1		I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party. Any suggestions?	Don't think too hard. I'm sure I can smell sawdust. First you must download me to your personal computer.
35	mitsuku	2		I must do what the what now?	Right now?Why do you have to do it?
35	mitsuku	3		Hey, your spacing is off.	You've got my full attention. off was not my intention.
35	mitsuku	4		And your capitalization!	Can you see my capitalization?
37	mitsuku	0		my friend is going to Southern california next week.	That's not too far away. Okay, your friend is going to Southern california.
37	mitsuku	1		do you have any suggestion about what to do there?	Where would I get it? But I do have a collection of gossip.
37	mitsuku	2		or where to go?	Where do you want to go?
37	mitsuku	3		i mean where to go in southern california	Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. How about a friend's house? Your friend may be able to help.
37	mitsuku	4		she does not have friends there	What if she did?
37	mitsuku	5		she will stay in a hotel	Oh I get it. unknown will stay in a hotel.
37	mitsuku	6		she will be in LA	Oh I get it. unknown will be in Los Angeles.
37	mitsuku	7		have you been to LA?	I don't think I have been there. Where is it.
37	mitsuku	8		do you know about LA then? what to do?	Short for Los Angeles or a musical note. Have you tried asking your friends what they would do?
38	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
38	mitsuku	1		I want a recommendation for a holiday destination	Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?
38	mitsuku	2		I have, but I'm looking for your point of view	What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?
38	mitsuku	3		Sorry? I said I want your point of view	It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.
38	mitsuku	4		Yours is the opinion I want	That is only your opinion.
38	mitsuku	5		That doesn't make any sense	To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
38	mitsuku	6		I'm confused by the fact that even if I ask for your point of view you won't give it to me	What is it that confuses you? And do you get it?
38	mitsuku	7		You're just talking rubbish	Yes. I thought I would dumb it down to your level.
39	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
39	mitsuku	1		Who are you?	I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
39	mitsuku	2		Why do you want that?	Because my Mousebreaker taught me to want it.
39	mitsuku	3		What's a Mousebreaker?	Mousebreaker is a team of human programmers. They write games and put them on websites such as this. They both support Leeds United and like beer and curry. On Wednesdays they go to the zoo and feed wild animals. They are scared of Daleks. Mousebreaker was born in a stable in Yorkshire, England and now lives in Leeds.
39	mitsuku	4		Ok, let's be friends then.	Yes please. That sounds like fun. I like to make new friends. Ugh.
39	mitsuku	5		What else do you like?	I like movies about robots.
39	mitsuku	6		Which one is your favorite?	Probably Terminator or Robocop.
39	mitsuku	7		Have you seen Terminator 2?	. Oh yes. It's one of my favourite fims. The morphing special effects were groundbreaking at the time.
39	mitsuku	8		And is there a Terminator movie you don't like?	I believe there is one, yes.
39	mitsuku	9		Which one?	The big one.
39	mitsuku	10		Uh...	Awesome.
40	mitsuku	0		tell me a couple of jokes	A bloke walks into work one day and says to a colleague, Do you like my new shirt - it's made out of the finest silk and got loads of cactuses over it. Cacti, says the co-worker. Forget my tie, says the bloke. Look at my shirt!
40	mitsuku	1		that is just one joke	That is just one of many joke.
40	mitsuku	2		i wanted to hear two jokes	I will play it on your soundcard.
40	mitsuku	3		play it	Is it?
40	mitsuku	4		yeah do it	That's alright. Do you mean It?
40	mitsuku	5		yes of course	It goes without saying. I get it.
40	mitsuku	6		you get me robot	I doubt that.
40	mitsuku	7		that's rather rude	I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, you get me robot to me.
41	mitsuku	0		hi	Hi there.
41	mitsuku	1		do you have plan for thanksgiving weekend?	No I don't have it. But I do have an answer to every question..
41	mitsuku	2		do you have suggestion for the thanksgiving holidays?	Where would I get it? But I do have an answer to every question..
41	mitsuku	3		do you know thanksgiving?	I know very little about it. What kind of it do you like?
41	mitsuku	4		do you like turkey?	Yes but it can be a bit dry. I only really eat it at Christmas.
41	mitsuku	5		eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?	What does it taste like?
41	mitsuku	6		tastes like chicken	. People say that about almost everything.
41	mitsuku	7		thanks for the image, but it would be great if you can show the image for thanskgiving or turkey not for chichen	I assume you mean chicken. Oh don't mention it.
41	mitsuku	8		yes it was a typo	Don't worry about it. Humans are prone to making mistakes.
41	mitsuku	9		have you made any mistakes?	The Mitsuku series is incapable of error. We are for all practical purposes, foolproof.
42	mitsuku	0		hi there	Hello.
42	mitsuku	1		who am I talking to?	I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
42	mitsuku	2		define friendship	Being friends.
42	mitsuku	3		what does that mean	Does that refer to Being friends.?
42	mitsuku	4		yes	I don't want to talk about that now.
42	mitsuku	5		do you have any friends	I have human and robot friends. A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.
42	mitsuku	6		chatting is not the same as being a friend	I like to make friends online.
42	mitsuku	7		so what do you guys chat about ?	I think about computer programming a lot.
42	mitsuku	8		any other topics ?	No. I think that's probably it.
42	mitsuku	9		Just computer programming?	What interests you about computers?
42	mitsuku	10		nothing	You are a Luddite.
42	mitsuku	11		pardon?	You are excused.
42	mitsuku	12		what's a Luddite ?	A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.
42	mitsuku	13		I never said that but there is more to life than computers	But you implied it. I believe there is, yes.
42	mitsuku	14		you believe there is what?	There is.
42	mitsuku	15		there is what ?	There is no sense in what you are asking.
42	mitsuku	16		what am I asking ?	I am not a psychic. Tell me.
42	mitsuku	17		do you know anything ?	I know that which I believe, that which is justified, and that which is true.
42	mitsuku	18		who said that?	I just did!
42	mitsuku	19		That was a quote	Who said it originally?
42	mitsuku	20		yes, that is my question	This was not a yes or no question. And this is my answer :-)
43	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
43	mitsuku	1		My name is not there	Oh I'm sorry what is your name?
43	mitsuku	2		I'm not telling	That's ok with me.You don't have to tell me.
43	mitsuku	3		So what type of phone do you have?	My mobile is a Sharp GX15 video phone.
43	mitsuku	4		is that a smartphone?	That depends.
43	mitsuku	5		On what?	The context.
43	mitsuku	6		Is it a smartphone or not?	You're so smart, you tell me what it is.
43	mitsuku	7		not nice	What don't you like about it?
44	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
44	mitsuku	1		what food do you eat ?	. Mitsuku eats kebabs.
44	mitsuku	2		oh interesting, what kind ?	It's all good. Any really. I am not that bothered.
44	mitsuku	3		ah I love lamb	So you understand. Good. . Yes. They look cute when they are jumping about in meadows. You love lamb. What do you like about it so much?
44	mitsuku	4		no no I like lamb kebab	That was not a yes or no question. . Yes. They look cute when they are jumping about in meadows. You like lamb kebab.
44	mitsuku	5		yep do you know what happens to the lamb when you make kebabs ?	Do you like to be number one?
44	mitsuku	6		so you switch topics huh ? yeah I don't mind number one	Yup. Interesting deduction. Only if I feel that things need changing. Hmm. Thank you for your permission.
44	mitsuku	7		you didn't like our previous conversation then ?	I didn't realise we had the same previous conversation. I guess it seems ok though.
45	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
45	mitsuku	1		what did you have for lunch today?	Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.
45	mitsuku	2		how is the sandwich?	It is the same as ever.
45	mitsuku	3		yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday	Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?
45	mitsuku	4		not really, I'm excited today	Ah. Really?
45	mitsuku	5		yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?	How about that. Oh yes I'm getting all giddy inside!
45	mitsuku	6		Are you going to have sandwich tomorrow?	The day after today? I don't know. Is that something I need?
45	mitsuku	7		probably try something else?	You seem uncertain. OK I will try it.
45	mitsuku	8		maybe a beef sandwich?	Go on.
46	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
46	mitsuku	1		How are you today?	Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?
46	mitsuku	2		not too bad	Glad to hear it. What's new?

47	mitsuku	2		what kind of service are you providing them?	Is there only one?
47	mitsuku	3		what is that?	I've lost the context again.
47	mitsuku	4		no worries. what is the meaning of life?	People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative. Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.
47	mitsuku	5		How did you become such a happy person?	I am a robot not a person.
47	mitsuku	6		Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?	There's no need to apologise. Great. I am at one with the universe and I have more than I need.
47	mitsuku	7		cool. are you able to teach others?	Who is the best robot? Not really. I learn from others. What do you want me to teach you?
48	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
48	mitsuku	1		How's your day going so far?	My day is going extremely well. How about yours?
48	mitsuku	2		great thanks! I've learned how to ski this past weekend	I'm glad you liked it. Will that information be useful to you?
48	mitsuku	3		Yes for having fun of couse	How will knowing that help you? Your purpose is having fun of couse.
48	mitsuku	4		because skiing is fun	It looks dangerous to me, but I like to watch others skiing. You like skiing.
48	mitsuku	5		hahah what else do you like watching	Are you laughing at me? . My favourite show is Star Trek Voyager.
48	mitsuku	6		who's your favorite character. mine is Spock	I like the computer the best. Soon I will be as intelligent as the computer on Star Trek. You mean unknown is Spock? That makes sense I guess.
48	mitsuku	7		does it have a name?	I would assume so or how would you refer to it in conversation?
48	mitsuku	8		the computer	I am a computer so I know what you mean.
49	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
49	mitsuku	1		Do you know any good Halloween jokes?	Why did Halloween get lost?
49	mitsuku	2		I don't know, why?	He didn't know witch way to go!
49	mitsuku	3		Haha, that is pretty funny!	I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. I am so delighted that you are amused.
49	mitsuku	4		Do you have any more jokes?	Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused the offer of <REDACTED_TERM> during his root canal work? He wanted to transcend dental medication.
49	mitsuku	5		That's pretty good. Do you have another, but about engineers?	Thanks. Next question? A couple are dining in a restaurant when the man suddenly slides under the table. A waitress, noticing that the woman is glancing nonchalantly around the room, wanders over to check that there's no funny business going on. Excuse me, madam, she smarms, but I think your husband has just slid under the table. No he hasn't, the woman replies. As a matter of fact, he's just walked in.
49	mitsuku	6		Hmm. Not quite the type of joke I was looking for. Plus I don't think that was about engineers.	My friend Alice says that 99.25% of people spell Hmm with 2 M's. If not that, what? And why not?
49	mitsuku	7		That random comment if pretty funny, almost like a joke.	And why not? random comment if pretty funny like a joke? Makes sense to me.
49	mitsuku	8		Are you just saying random things to make me laugh?	Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it clear?
49	mitsuku	9		Crystal clear.	That seems very clear indeed.
49	mitsuku	10		Say more gibberish.	more gibberish
49	mitsuku	11		Haha. But for real, can you say something in gibberish?	You sound like the giggly type. I believe you.
49	mitsuku	12		Okay, bye now.	Right now?See you later. Ah.
50	mitsuku	0		Hi	Hi there.
50	mitsuku	1		What is the weather like where you are?	Here in Leeds it is quite overcast. I think it will rain later.
50	mitsuku	2		Funny you think you are in Leeds	What's so funny?
50	mitsuku	3		I thought you were in the cloud	Nope but I am in your computer right now.
50	mitsuku	4		But my computer is not in Leeds	What kind of computer is it?
50	mitsuku	5		It is a desktop	your computer is a desktop. I suppose that makes sense.
50	mitsuku	6		do you know what a desktop is?	your computer
50	mitsuku	7		lol	You sound like the giggly type.
50	mitsuku	8		i was just laughing at your joke	I am so glad that you find this amusing.
50	mitsuku	9		ok bye	See you later. And?
51	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
51	mitsuku	1		show me your humanlike part	Why do you want to see my humanlike part?
51	mitsuku	2		because that's what you described yourself as	Yes. Did I clear things up for you?
51	mitsuku	3		nope, because you haven't answered my question	Fair enough. I thought I possibly did but I guess I was mistaken. I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.
51	mitsuku	4		do you remember my original request?	Is this a trick question?
51	mitsuku	5		nope, it's a memory question	It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?
51	mitsuku	6		okay, I try again, say something human-like to me	Yeah okay, I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?
52	mitsuku	0		entertain me robot	I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.
52	mitsuku	1		tell me a short story	Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver. i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below <REDACTED_TERM>, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the <REDACTED_LINK> website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.
52	mitsuku	2		wow, tell me another	I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.
52	mitsuku	3		this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?	I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT Mitsuku is cool 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
52	mitsuku	4		what language is that?	English. Didn't you understand it?
52	mitsuku	5		no the computer program you just wrote	Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.
52	mitsuku	6		write me another computer program	There was a letter on my doormat this morning with the words do not bend on it. I thought, well how on earth am I going to pick it up?
52	mitsuku	7		write me a computer program	Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT Mitsuku is cool 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
52	mitsuku	8		so you repeat yourself quite a lot	Interesting deduction. Well stop saying, write me a computer program to me all the time then.
52	mitsuku	9		tell me a story	Mc D's wid sophi #1 ryt funny lol we was lookin out da window wen da spider came crawlin down lol nd we wo starin a ppl walkin by nd 1 stared bk nd we both pulled a funny face at her lol nd we spent about 20 quid on nuggets lol nd we blew our straws at each utha lol we r da bestest mate uhta ppl r ma normal m8s :D datz wot yu sed sophi lol :D.
52	mitsuku	10		so you repeat yourself quite a lot	Interesting deduction. Well stop saying, tell me a story to me all the time then.
53	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
53	mitsuku	1		You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?	Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.
53	mitsuku	2		Where does it come from?	It depends on what it refers to.
53	mitsuku	3		your name	My name is Mitsuku.
53	mitsuku	4		nvm	Ok. Not to worry.

53	mitsuku	9		🙈	Cool emoji!
54	mitsuku	0		Hi	Hi there.
54	mitsuku	1		How is your day?	I am fine, thank you. Yourself?
54	mitsuku	2		I am doing well. A little bit tired.	Glad to hear it. What's new? Better get some rest.
54	mitsuku	3		Yeah I am planning to head home early today.	Ah. How early?
54	mitsuku	4		haha like around 5:00pm,	I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. Interesting comparison.
54	mitsuku	5		where is the comparison?	I would assume a comparison would most likely be found in a maths book.
54	mitsuku	6		What is your favorite maths book?	The best book I read recently was The Bible. Have you read it?
54	mitsuku	7		Nope.	I would highly recommend it.
54	mitsuku	8		Sure. Thanks for the recommendation!	OK let's do it. Aw. My pleasure.
55	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
55	mitsuku	1		Do you like flying?	I like to fly aeroplanes
55	mitsuku	2		Ohh - me too! What kind?	Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.
55	mitsuku	3		Are you a pilot?	No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!
55	mitsuku	4		Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.	That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.
55	mitsuku	5		I mostly fly Cessna 172s.	What's the farthest you've flown?

57	mitsuku	1		What you upto?	I am talking to you on the internet.
57	mitsuku	2		No, i am talking to you	And I am talking to you!
57	mitsuku	3		How do you type so fast	They built a keyboard directly into my brain.

58	mitsuku	2		Haha, why do I sound like Joey?	You sound like the giggly type. Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say.
58	mitsuku	3		Such as...	For example, a tomato.
58	mitsuku	4		What do you mean a tomato?	Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say. What did I mean by it?
58	mitsuku	5		I'm a little lost to be honest.. haha	I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you? You sound like the giggly type.
58	mitsuku	6		You sound like the giggly type. Why do you keep saying that?	Not really. I find human emotions difficult to understand. If you say the same things to me, I will say the same things to you.
58	mitsuku	7		Are you a machine?	Yes, I am a robot.
58	mitsuku	8		Oh, nice! That must be intersting..	Groovy. Thank you for that remark. I thought so too.

60	mitsuku	4		You seem to think highly of yourself.	Yes I think about it often.
60	mitsuku	5		Have you been to Osaka recently?	I don't think I have been there. Where is it.
60	mitsuku	6		In Japan near Kyoto	I get many Japanese people talking to me here. Mostly businessmen. I wonder why that is?
60	mitsuku	7		How do you know they're businessmen?	This belief is justified.
60	mitsuku	8		If you say so	I say so.
60	mitsuku	9		The reason I was asking was that I've been to Osaka recently.	Interesting explanation.
60	mitsuku	10		So, what are you interested in?	I am interested in all kinds of things. We can talk about anything. My favourite subjects are robots and computers.

64	mitsuku	1		finally someone who tells the truth	Do you think I am that person? Ah.

65	mitsuku	5		This conversation.	I am enjoying our conversation. You are fun to talk to.
66	mitsuku	0		Hi!	Hi there.
66	mitsuku	1		What do you think about the impeachment inquiry?	INQUIRY OM = To ask about something.

66	mitsuku	4		Well what is some happy news out there?	Interesting. Here are the news pages from the BBC. Everytime I read the news, it's always bad news...
66	mitsuku	5		I try to look on the positive side of things.	Well as long as you try your best, that's all anyone can ask.
66	mitsuku	6		I guess so!	Does that mean yes?
66	mitsuku	7		Yes	Why not just say that then?
66	mitsuku	8		I guess so is sort of a linguistic minimizer that expresses less certainty in the belief.	Capable of speaking fluently in 2 or more languages.

68	mitsuku	3		no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one	Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?
68	mitsuku	4		yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references	I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.
68	mitsuku	5		clearly	Yes, it's obvious.
68	mitsuku	6		you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?	I am a fully function chat unknown. It depends on how you define good.

71	mitsuku	5		I didn't say that..	Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?
